Vehicle -> Webcam: Vehicle approaches (distance <= 50 cm)
Webcam -> System: Capture frame
System -> System: Check mock ultrasonic distance
alt Distance <= 50 cm
    System -> YOLO: Process frame for plate detection
    YOLO --> System: Return bounding boxes
    loop for each bounding box
        System -> System: Extract ROI (plate image)
        alt ROI valid (width >= 50, height >= 20)
            System -> Tesseract: Perform OCR on plate image
            Tesseract --> System: Return plate text
            System -> System: Extract and validate plate (e.g., RA123H)
            alt Plate is valid
                System -> System: Add plate to buffer
                alt Buffer has >= 3 readings
                    System -> System: Get most common plate
                    alt Consistent readings (count >= 2)
                        System -> CSV: Check for active entry
                        CSV --> System: Return active entry status
                        alt No active entry
                            System -> CSV: Log plate, Payment Status=0, Entry Timestamp, Amount=""
                            CSV --> System: Confirm log
                            System -> Webcam: Save plate image
                            System -> Arduino: Send '1' (open gate)
                            Arduino --> System: Gate opened
                            System -> System: Wait 15 seconds
                            System -> Arduino: Send '0' (close gate)
                            Arduino --> System: Gate closed
                            System -> System: Update last saved plate and time
                        else Active entry exists

end alt
System -> Webcam: Display annotated frame
Vehicle -> System: Press 'q' to quit (optional)
System -> Webcam: Release camera
System -> Arduino: Close connection
System -> System: Destroy windows
